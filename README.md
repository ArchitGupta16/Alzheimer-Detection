# Alzheimer-Detection

This repository contains all resources for the detection and analysis of Alzheimer's disease using three prominent datasets. By leveraging our own train from scratch Convolutional Neural Network, we aim to aid in the early detection and progression tracking of Alzheimer's disease. The datasets used in this project include a variety of imaging and clinical data, offering a comprehensive approach to studying the disease.

1. Alzheimer Dataset
- The data consists of MRI images. The data has four classes of images
- - Mild Demented
- - Moderate Demented
- - Non Demented
- - Very Mild Demented

2. ADNI Axial Dataset
- The dataset consists of 3 folders with all images from axial plane
- - AD consisting of images of Alzheimer's patients
- - CI containing images of MCI patients 
- - CN containing images of Normal subjects

3. OASIS Dataset
- The dataset used is the OASIS MRI dataset, which consists of 80,000 brain MRI images. The images have been divided into four classes based on Alzheimer's progression.
- - Mild Demented
- - Moderate Demented
- - Non Demented
